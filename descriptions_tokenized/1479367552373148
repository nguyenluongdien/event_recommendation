Do you love kids and yoga ?
Join instructor Suzanne_Vian RCYT , E-RYT , for a meaningful weekend of learning to teach yoga to kids .
Children are naturally creative and fun loving - help them to channel their energy " mindfully " .
Inspire the children in your life to build strength and stability , while keeping them engaged and stimulating their incredible imaginations through the practices of yoga and mindfulness . Teach them techniques to calm and center themselves , while cultivating a deeper body and mind connection and mental , physical and emotional balance .
This experiential training will teach you to share the practice through yoga stories , movement , music and games geared to teach kids how to be more mindful and aware .
You do not need to be a yoga teacher to teach kids yoga . Anyone can take this course and share what is learned during this training with children , even those new to the practice .
This 2 day program will explore theory , games , and exercises appropriate for all ages , from toddlers to teens .
3 hours of course homework will be done on your free time , to support what you learn during your training .
