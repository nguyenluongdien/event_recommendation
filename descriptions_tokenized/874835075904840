Loud_Minority and Pasteur_Street_Brewing_Company are delighted to announce that award - winning hip - hop artist , ODDISEE will be taking in Saigon on his maiden Asia tour this November .
Winner of i Tunes_Hip_Hop_Album of the Year award in 2012 , Oddisee ( Amir_Mohamed ) is the son of Sudanese and American parents , and was born and raised in the United_States capital city of Washington DC , spending hot summers in Khartoum learning Arabic and swimming in the Nile .
Growing up amidst the sounds of New_York hip_hop , his father playing Oud , Go-Go , and gospel , Amir took his first steps as an MC/producer in the analog basement studio of his legendary neighbor , Garry_Shider ( Parliament , Funkadelic ) .
Though_Oddisee has gone on to perform with The_Roots , produce for Freeway , Jazzy_Jeff , Little_Brother , De_La_Soul & Nikki_Jean , and collaborate with Kendrick_Lamar , J_Cole , Flying_Lotus , Hudson_Mohawke and Kev_Brown , his proudest moment was the birth of his critically acclaimed group The_Diamond_District with fellow Washingtonians X . O . and y U .
Oddisee ’ s debut album " People_Hear_What_They_See " ( released June 2012 ) is a culmination of the duality of his life experiences , from DC internal politics to third world struggles , the line between love and selfishness , and the personal conflict between self - sabotage and progress set to a backdrop of intricate drums , lush instrumentation , and soul - stirring harmonies . It has received widespread acclaim at a time when the genre seems to have lost its way among a sea of self - aggrandizing and petty squabbles . The album hit the billboards in both North_America and Europe in June 2012 and was supported by large tours taking in over 70 cities .
Oddisee ’ s 2015 follow-up , The_Good_Fight , picks up where his debut left off and takes the listener on a more soulful jazz tip with a rich musicality while the lyrical content remains poignant and grounded in reality . His idiosyncratic delivery is unmistakable and true to his identity , even rapping in Arabic on ‘ A_List of Withouts ’ .
As one of the most exciting and ground - breaking artists in hip - hop today , we are extremely excited that this prodigious talent will be gracing the Loud_Minority stage on 17th November at Cargo .
