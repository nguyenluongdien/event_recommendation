Wise , funny , and heartbreaking , Persepolis is Marjane_Satrapi ’ s memoir of growing up in Iran during the Islamic_Revolution . In powerful black - and-white comic strip images , Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen , years that saw the overthrow of the Shah ’ s regime , the triumph of the Islamic_Revolution , and the devastating effects of war with Iraq . The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great - granddaughter of one of Iran ’ s last emperors , Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country .
Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life . Marjane ’ s child ’ s-eye view of dethroned emperors , state-sanctioned whippings , and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family . Intensely personal , profoundly political , and wholly original , Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression . It shows how we carry on , with laughter and tears , in the face of absurdity . And , finally , it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love
