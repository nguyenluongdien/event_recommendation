It is indispensable to know where we come from , where we are going , why we are here , for what purpose . To live for the sake of living , to eat in order to exist , and to work in order to eat , cannot truly be the single purpose of life . Undoubtedly , we need to solve the enigma of our existence ; we need to understand the sense of life . The time has come to know who we are . The physical body is not everything ; seeing any person ’ s human organism does not mean having really known their BEING .
So we will see how in Ancient_Egypt they were working in order to solve this problem , through the Inner_Path , but most important how this changed until our days .
When someone asks himself : “ Who am I ? Where do I come from ? Where am I going to ? What is the purpose of my existence ? ” he or she is ready to discover The_Inner_Path .
We will continue with other courses related to self development ,
instrospective psichology , meditation .
