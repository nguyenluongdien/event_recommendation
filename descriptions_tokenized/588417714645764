DJ_VADIM
DJ Vadim has become well respected as an innovator in a number of areas during his career , " a veteran presence in the DJ community as well as one of the foremost producers in too many communities to count , Vadim is never running out of ideas " ( URB Magazine ) . In 1994 , Vadim founded his own independent record label , Jazz_Fudge and signed to Ninja_Tune the following year . So begun Vadim ’ s adventure that is now approaching its twentieth year and has seen him tour across 69 countries and perform over 2500 times , with shows at some of the world ’ s most prestigious events such as Sonar , Glastonbury , Big_Chill , V_Fest , Fuji_Rock , Roskilde , Exit , VInarock , Moscow_Street_Ball ( to over 40,000 people ) , Notting_Hill_Carnival and Shambhala … To describe the man as an internationalist almost seems to sell him short .
Hard to put a peg on because he sticks to no rule - book , Vadim ’ s sound is not easy to describe , but it ’ s electronic , hip_hop inspired and tinged with reggae , trip hop , soul , funk , grime , dub and bass , with elements of African rhythms , house and boogie . Vadim has produced numerous solo and group albums across these genres , recording in the studio and on his travels around the world , melding flavours and rhythms to create globally aware music with global appeal ; he has been responsible for seminal underground classics such as The_Terrorist , Black is the Night , Kill_Kill_Kill , Soldier , Talk to me and Bluebird and has worked with a variety of breaking talent and established artists , musicians , singers and groups , including Wretch32 , Foreign_Beggars , Alice_Russell , Aaron_Jerome ( SBTRKT ) , DJ Krush , The_Herbaliser , Belleruche , Killa_Kela , Fat_Freddy ’ s Drop and The_Super_Furry_Animals . He is an evolutionist in sound , described once as ‘ the John_Coltrane of Hip_Hop , ‘ always pushing boundaries , always collaborating .
For an artist with such a long recording pedigree it would be easy to sit in cruise control , knock_out music by numbers , and stay in the box , or just reproduce or re - hash earlier ideas . This however isn ’ t Vadim . One look at the discography and Vadim was there before people coined phrases for genres ... making dubby bugged out ‘ step ’ music years before people even had heard of Croydon musically , creating future beats before people called it trip hop or headz , distorting basslines and drums before Glitch or Diplo and running his own record label ( Jazz_Fudge ) before the advent of indie music . However it hasn ’ t all been clear sailing . In 1999 , the US broadcast commission ( FCC ) decided absurdly enough that a pro - women empowerment record ( Your_Revolution featuring Sarah_Jones ) was too ‘ crude ’ for radio whilst allowing countless records that promote negativity to go . The decision ended up in court several years later under appeal with several leading Ivy league English professors coming to the defense of freedom of speech , freedom of expression and to argue the double standards of the ban and fine .
In 2007 , Vadim was diagnosed with Ocular_Melanoma , a very rare eye cancer . Fortunately for us , it wasn ’ t his time . Vadim has more music to make , and more shows to play ; 6 solo albums to date , 1 remix album , 5 group albums ( The_Isolationist - 1999 ; The_Bug - 1994 , One_Self - 2005 ; The_Electric - 2011 ) , countless mix cd ’ s and remixes . Hardest working man in show business ? Trouper ? Tireless ? However you want to put it , be sure of one thing , when DJ Vadim first heard the phrase " Don ’ t sleep ” he obviously took it literally .
With so much under his belt , what does the future hold ? Not content with being uber busy , Vadim has taken it upon himself to film and direct music videos for his new album project , developing his eye as a budding photographer . Music aside , there is even word of a possible pop - up restaurant and bar . If the music is anything to go by , it will be very fine tasting stuff .
