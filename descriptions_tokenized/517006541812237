Night in Saigon ( NIS ) is our annual Vietnamese culture show organized by UGA_VSA members . We invite hundreds of people from all over the states to join us for a night of acting , singing , dancing , and more ! Our theme this year , A_New_Balance , embodies the ongoing struggle our generation encounters when amidst two different cultural identities .
AND ! Through NIS , we actively strive to help the Vietnamese community locally and abroad . Our philanthropy this year is Kids_Without_Borders ( KWB ) , specifically their " Teach_Me to Fish " program . The focus of the project is to provide orphans in Vietnam with an exit plan for life after the orphanage . KWB provides help with the children ' s studies by giving after - school classes and scholarships .
