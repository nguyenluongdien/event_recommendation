Loud_Minority & Pasteur_Street_Brewing_Company are excited to announce our next headline show with Denmark ' s most hotly - tipped artist for 2016 , Lydmor .
Behind the curious and quite self - ironic name Lydmor ( Danish for “ Mother of Sound ” ) , you find the 25-year old , Danish singer , songwriter and producer Jenny_Rossander .
Despite of her young age , Lydmor has experienced more than most musicians ever will . She have toured most of mainland Europe and southeast Asia on her own , been on “ trust tours ” all across the European continent , where she performed , lived and slept in the homes of her fans , collaborated with renowned artists such as Arsenal ( BE ) , Alle_Farben ( DE ) , Amanda_Palmer ( US ) , Bottled in England ( DK ) , etc . and finally established herself as one of the most promising underground artists in her native Denmark .
Now_Lydmor is ready to launch her solo career onto a whole new level . Fearlessly the young Dane exposes all of herself in the quest of achieving true artistic integrity , and with the release of her new album “ y ” , Lydmor has done just that . Stacked with intensity , emotion and personal experience , the album portrays a woman far beyond her age telling stories of love , intoxication and deprivation with Lydmor ’ s fragile and yet breathtaking voice , on top of an ambient and oddly catchy , electronic soundscape .
Lydmor is truly one of a kind , but to really appreciate her uniqueness , you have to hear it for yourself . Welcome to the Lydmor experience !
