We not only arrange trips solely by location , but we also arrange trips on various photographic themes . Why would you come all this way to take photos of areas , subjects , and themes that you do not like ? With all of our distinctive locations , we found that we have been able to cater to a number of themes . Ultimately no trip has ever been the same . Some photographers may prefer to focus on Photojournalism & Travel_Photography themes . Other photographers have been captivated by the rich and dynamic cultures here , which can be seen by focusing on Architecture and Fashion_Photography themes . Other photographers have preferred to mix things up and explore our Scenic & Landscape themes which have been paired up well with our Action & Dance themes . But there is no need to pick only one or two , as we can arrange it so that each photo shoot is distinctive and has a different theme .
