:::Who we are:::
We're a group of people from a variety of different countries that meet once a week to chat, meet new people and practice speaking languages.

:::How it Works:::

We have little flag stickers from over 100 countries / regions. The first flag is your native language and goes at the top. The rest follow in order or ability. It's open to all nationalities and languages and you can talk about anything you like. You don´t have to be an advanced speaker, or even speak a second language - its for all levels!

:::Our spot:::

Our events are free for participants, and always will be. When you arrive just ask at the bar or look for the table with the flags. If you’re shy, send a message to us first and feel free to ask for any information.
