Happy Holiday Season to everyone! Saigon Outcast has a special present for all those holiday hipsters that need a well deserved break. The 2nd Saigon Outcast BeerFest will be coming just in time for the snow to start falling (somewhere else). Soak up the sunshine, great music, delicious craft beer and cider, and internationally diverse cookery that will be sure to satisfy your palate. 

	Always outdoing itself, Saigon outcast has gathered even more vendors from the craft drink and food scene in Saigon to break bread (and beer) with each other. The event will feature Fuzzy Logic, Pasteur Street Brewing Company, Platinum Premium Ale, Phat Rooster, Eagle Pilsner, Te Te Wheat style beer, Kiss Cider, Saigon Cider, and all your favourite local adult beverages.

The many great beverage choices make this Saigon Outcast BeerFest a great option to keep cool this holiday season. Add great food, passionate brewers, and live music — this will be one you won’t want to miss.
