We not only arrange trips solely by location, but we also arrange trips on various photographic themes. Why would you come all this way to take photos of areas, subjects, and themes that you do not like? With all of our distinctive locations, we found that we have been able to cater to a number of themes. Ultimately no trip has ever been the same. Some photographers may prefer to focus on Photojournalism & Travel Photography themes. Other photographers have been captivated by the rich and dynamic cultures here, which can be seen by focusing on Architecture and Fashion Photography themes. Other photographers have preferred to mix things up and explore our Scenic & Landscape themes which have been paired up well with our Action & Dance themes. But there is no need to pick only one or two, as we can arrange it so that each photo shoot is distinctive and has a different theme.
