The Vietnamese Lunar New Year a.k.a. Tet Nguyen Dan, or “Tet” for short, is considered the biggest and most popular celebration of the year. It represents the opportunity for new beginnings and is celebrated with much excitement and anticipation.

In preparation to ring in the celebratory spirit of Tet, these conjoining events—parade, open-air marketplace, food festival, live performing arts and carnival games & rides—will provide media exposure to support the visibility of the local businesses and the nationally designated “Little Saigon” of Sacramento business and cultural district by celebrating and showcasing the Vietnamese culture, tradition, cuisine, performances and arts.

The celebration will start with the Little Saigon Tet Parade with a jubilation of music, the roaring of classic cars, colorful floats, and cultural performances for all spectators. The parade will travel south on Stockton Boulevard commencing at Fruitridge Road at 9:00 AM and culminating at Florin Road for the Grand Opening Ceremony of the Lunar Flower Fest where the festivities will continue for the entire family to enjoy for the next two days.
