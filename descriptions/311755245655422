November 26th - La Haine (France 1995)
La Haine became an instant cult for its grim and poetic black-and-white cinematography and for depicting the reality of marginalised ethnic minorities in the outskirt of Paris. The film follows the daily life of three young adults – Vinz (Vincent Cassel), Hubert (Hubert Koundé) and Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui). The three protagonists are of Jewish, Afro-French and Arab descendants and writer-director Mathieu Kassovitz uses them as archetypes to bring out the resentment, isolation and sense of displacement that these ethnic citizens face in France. Although fictional, La Haine is shot as a documentary and it is for its realism that attracted both criticisms as well as praises for its bold and violent portrait of the dysfunctional relationship between France and its multi-ethnic citizens.
