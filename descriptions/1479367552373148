Do you love kids and yoga? 

Join instructor Suzanne Vian RCYT, E-RYT, for a meaningful weekend of learning to teach yoga to kids. 
Children are naturally creative and fun loving- help them to channel their energy "mindfully". 

Inspire the children in your life to build strength and stability,  while keeping them engaged and stimulating their incredible imaginations through the practices of yoga and mindfulness. Teach them techniques to calm and center themselves, while cultivating a deeper body and mind connection and mental, physical and emotional balance. 

This experiential training will teach you to share the practice through yoga stories, movement, music and games geared to teach kids how to be more mindful and aware. 

You do not need to be a yoga teacher to teach kids yoga. Anyone can take this course and share what is learned during this training with children, even those new to the practice. 

This 2 day program will explore theory, games, and exercises appropriate for all ages, from toddlers to teens. 
3 hours of course homework will be done on your free time, to support what you learn during your training.
