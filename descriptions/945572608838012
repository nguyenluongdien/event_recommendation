ABOUT YOUR TRIP

Ho Chi Minh City, situated in the southeastern region of Vietnam, is a treasure trove of historical landmarks, ancient architecture, and modern skyscrapers like the Bitexco Financial Tower. Absorb the culture at Giac Lam Pagoda, Gia Long Palace, and the Museum of Vietnamese History. For fun, there's Dam Sen Water Park, Suoi Tien Amusement Park and the Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens.

At Ho Chi Minh Agricultural Villages, you'll learn the ins and outs of growing and cultivating a garden, selecting raw fruits and vegetables, and putting all your knowledge to the test with a cooking class. For more adventure, you'll be touring the Cu Chi Tunnel system. Used during the Vietnam War, you'll walk through the labyrinth of dimly lit tunnels, see displays of bobby traps, and have a meal in the underground command center.
