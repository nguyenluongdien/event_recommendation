Visiting Acro Revolution teacher Aaron Levy will be back in Saigon on Saturday afternoon, so come along for an afternoon mini-workshop style Jam. Aaron will continue to introduce us to some new fun & challenging Acro moves. Everyone who attended on Thursday night at Yoga Sculpt n' Shape will agree that it was an awesome night - we all had loads of fun and learnt a lot from Aaron! :-)
