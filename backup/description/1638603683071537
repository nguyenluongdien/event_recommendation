Stephane Laporte(de Paris) is keen to grow your Swing potential in this new batch of 6 Wednesdays with cool variations on Swing Out, how to switch from 6 to 8 counts, more musicality trickeries (basically how you can dance with music better) and also some awesome Charleston moves.
Exciting news: Haley Barlar is a talented dancer who has just arrived in Saigon for a few months from Atlanta, US. She'll start teaching the Saigon Swing Cats- Swing 2 class with Stephane for the first time!!! (drum roll)

Anyone who has already taken Swing 1 (comfortable with the basic Swing Out 8-count) and have been dancing relatively active on 6-count East Coast Swing can join the class.
Payment (VND 590K per person or VND 900k per couple including 1 Lead + 1 Follow) can be made after the 1st class to teacher.
