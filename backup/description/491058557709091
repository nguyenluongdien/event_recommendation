ABOUT YOUR TRIP 

Looming near the fertile sprawl of the Mekong Delta, Ho Chi Minh City is a huge, gleaming city with a buzzing and captivating atmosphere. It was called Saigon for centuries, including when, as the seat of the South Vietnamese government, it figured so prominently during the Vietnam War. Its contemporary verve and historical monuments make it one of Southeast Asia’s most satisfying destinations.

Your full-day guided tour of the Mekong Delta will include the fishing villages and evocatively named delta islands of Dragon, Unicorn, Tortoise and Phoenix via the Tien River as well as a trek through coconut plantations and traditional settlements by horse-drawn cart. Top off the day with a rowboat ride out to Thoi Son Island, where, while refreshing yourself with tropical fruit and honey tea, you’ll enjoy a live performance of “Don Ca Tai Tu,” the traditional folk music of southern Vietnam. For a look at another side of Vietnamese heritage, you’ll have a half-day guided tour via jeep of the Cu Chi Tunnels, where you’ll learn about the Vietnam War's legacy.
