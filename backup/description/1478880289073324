Our cycle challenge takes us from Vietnamese Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, through the rice-paddies and waterways of the beautiful Mekong Delta into Cambodia, We pedal on through this friendly country towards one of the most impressive sights in southeast Asia, the Royal Temples of Angkor Wat. We encounter a few rolling hills, but the main challenge lies in the long, hot humid days in the saddle with the occasional tropical downpour. The fascinating insight into the region's cultures, ancient and modern, are a real highlight of the trip!
