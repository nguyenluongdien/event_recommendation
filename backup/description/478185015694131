From the creators of Les Misérables comes a moving international sensation that is a testament to the human spirit and a scathing indictment of the tragedies of the Vietnam War. A classic love story is brought to the modern world in one of the most stunning theatrical spectacles of all time, Miss Saigon.

We are seeking male and female actors ages 18 and up. All roles are open.  Auditions will consist of a vocal and dance portion. Prepare 16-32 bars of a song that best showcases your vocal ability. Bring a theatre resume and sheet music.  An accompanist will be provided.

Rehearsals will take place on Sundays from 12-3pm, and Monday/Thursday evenings from 6:30-9:30pm. Miss Saigon will run May 6th-8th, 2016, and is presented by The Encore Repertory Company.
