*winner of iTunes 'Hip Hop Album of the Year' 2012

***************************************************************************

Loud Minority and Pasteur Street Brewing Company are delighted to announce that award-winning hip-hop artist, ODDISEE will be taking in Saigon on his maiden Asia tour this November.

Winner of iTunes Hip Hop Album of the Year award in 2012, Oddisee (Amir Mohamed) is the son of Sudanese and American parents, and was born and raised in the United States capital city of Washington DC, spending hot summers in Khartoum learning Arabic and swimming in the Nile.

Growing up amidst the sounds of New York hip hop, his father playing Oud, Go-Go, and gospel, Amir took his first steps as an MC/producer in the analog basement studio of his legendary neighbor, Garry Shider (Parliament, Funkadelic). 

Though Oddisee has gone on to perform with The Roots, produce for Freeway, Jazzy Jeff, Little Brother, De La Soul & Nikki Jean, and collaborate with Kendrick Lamar, J Cole, Flying Lotus, Hudson Mohawke and Kev Brown, his proudest moment was the birth of his critically acclaimed group The Diamond District with fellow Washingtonians X.O. and yU.

Oddisee’s debut album "People Hear What They See" (released June 2012) is a culmination of the duality of his life experiences, from DC internal politics to third world struggles, the line between love and selfishness, and the personal conflict between self-sabotage and progress set to a backdrop of intricate drums, lush instrumentation, and soul-stirring harmonies. It has received widespread acclaim at a time when the genre seems to have lost its way among a sea of self-aggrandizing and petty squabbles.  The album hit the billboards in both North America and Europe in June 2012 and was supported by large tours taking in over 70 cities.

Oddisee’s 2015 follow-up, The Good Fight, picks up where his debut left off and takes the listener on a more soulful jazz tip with a rich musicality while the lyrical content remains poignant and grounded in reality. His idiosyncratic delivery is unmistakable and true to his identity, even rapping in Arabic on ‘A List of Withouts’.

As one of the most exciting and ground-breaking artists in hip-hop today, we are extremely excited that this prodigious talent will be gracing the Loud Minority stage on 17th November at Cargo.
