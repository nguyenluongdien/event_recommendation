Operari sequitur esse

Tis time to become the change you wish to see in the world. 

(Operation Unite: Sunday October 2nd and Monday 3rd.) 

A Million Paws Unleashed Justice - April 4th Global March For Dogs and Cats in the Pet Meat Trade: 

2015 this April 4th and 5th Say No To Dog Meat - The Australian registered organisation made history hosting the worlds first international anti pet meat demonstration. 

In over twenty five countries and some forty cities worldwide countless organisations from Asia to Australia, Great Britain to the United States stood with us and made aware the horrors of the pet meat trade on a global level. 

Everyone who joined felt a sense of enjoyment, achievement and were satisfied to be volunteering or working alongside a great team of dedicated and enthusiastic animal welfare specialists and environmentalists. 

Say No To Dog Meat's main mission was to make our voices heard not just around the globe but to governments and ministers alike. To educate where needed and input education plans where they had never been in place before. 

The team at Say No To Dog Meat didn't just educate adults whom knew nothing about this horrific trade but hundreds and hundreds of school children in schools across Asia, Europe and America. 

The Global March for Dogs and Cats in the Meat Trade was a success. Now its time to implement #OperationUnite which will see change happen.

Say No To Dog Meat: Operari sequitur esse
Operation Unite - It's time. 

Operation Unite forms Say No To Dog Meat's largest ever global events that will take the globe by storm peacefully. However, where we made our voices heard back in April 4th and 5th 2015, its now time to put our voices and actions into practice to lobby for change and make that change happen for dogs and cats in the meat industry. 

Operation Unite divides what was seen on the 4th and 5th April into 

1. Public Lobbying Campaign Group.
2. Say No To Dog Meat Education Team. 
3. Demonstration and Awareness. 
4. Static Awareness Events.
5. Political Lobbyist Team. 

1) Public Lobbying Campaign Group. 

The public lobbying campaign group will be creating awareness of the trade by educating the public about the dog and cat mat meat trade. An example of such an educative event can be seen here when the Tel Aviv activists held their own event this April 4th in Israeli -
