The Academy Center of the Arts is thrilled to host the American Shakespeare Center and their production of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. 

Profoundly moving, breathtaking, and deeply human. Shakespeare shows us a world on fire; turned upside down; a world where some of historyâ€™s most famous men commit horrific crimes in the name of patriotism and honor. Julius Caesar is a dazzling thrill ride of betrayal, violence, and perhaps most surprisingly- love.
