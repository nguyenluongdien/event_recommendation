The legendary musical from the creators of Les Misérables

Cameron Mackintosh’s acclaimed new production has made its highly anticipated return to the West End, and is breaking box office records.

Since Miss Saigon’s sensational record-breaking run at London’s Theatre Royal Drury Lane 25 years ago it has played in 300 cities in 15 different languages, winning awards around the world.

This epic musical love story tells the tragic tale of young bar girl Kim, orphaned by war, who falls in love with an American GI called Chris – but their lives are torn apart by the fall of Saigon.
