Saigon climbers Æ¡i !
Let's set up a team and proudly defend our colors at VietClimb 5th National Bouldering Competition (Hanoi, 6th December 2015).

Let's register and book our flights ASAP to make sure we all have a great week-end at this not-to-be-missed event of the year.

Vertical Academy will offer physical preparation classes & clinic sessions on Thursdays evenings and (upon request) on Saturdays and/or Sundays mornings.
