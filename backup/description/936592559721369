Thank you so much for all of your amazing support last week for Bamboora's Dj competition to open at royale. We didn't win, HOWEVER, becuse we have such amazing fans and friends, Bamboora asked us to open for him at Whisky Saigon! We would love you even more if you came out to dance the night away with us. Our set starts at 10pm and goes until 11pm. We will also be geting a couple of drinks before the show to celebrate Comatose's birthday coming up on the 29th so feel free to join along :D. Please let us know if you can come. Much love and thank you again for the amazing support from you all! <3 <3 <3
