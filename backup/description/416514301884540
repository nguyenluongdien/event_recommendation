THE EVENT IS OPEN TO ALL

With special guest Worship Leader and recording Artist Nathan Jess .

Our worship ministry is vitally important to Hope Church Malta’s ethos, culture, spiritual temperature and growth,

 We are committed to developing a bold and loud worship ministry through a creative mix of practical talents and best and realistic use of available resources. We look to help equip teams on one hand to effectively run rehearsals, sound checks, finding songs, learning songs, growing as a team together, developing as singers or musicians, ability to deal with technical problems, managing very tight resources……. and the list goes on. On the other hand teams capable of ushering us into His presence, connecting heaven and earth, helping people connect with their maker, lifting heads, raising our faith, giving God the honour and his resultant response.

The program of the will be made up of, worship and prayer but also a wide range of practical workshops and seminars tackling wide ranging topics such as ‘playing together as a team’, ‘vocal training’, ‘team building’, ‘running effective rehearsals’, recording songs and many more.
 
OPEN to any Church, worship teams, Songwriters and private individuals.
