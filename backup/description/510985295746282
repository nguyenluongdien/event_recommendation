A dinner for present & future CoSI members to kick off the new year at the best Vietnamese restaurant in town.

Date & Time TBA, please post best days/times for you and we can get something lined up. 

We could all meet on campus and carpool. I think a Friday night would be best when we don't have homework or class to worry about and can have a little party!
