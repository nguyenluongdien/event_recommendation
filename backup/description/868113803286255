The Howland Chamber Music Circle is excited to introduce something new this season! We’re embracing Beacon’s Second Saturday celebrations by offering occasional concerts outside our regular series. We're calling them our "Pop-Up" concerts. We encourage all to attend and to bring friends, especially those who might be new to our series. It’s the high quality performances you’ve come to expect from HCMC, but it’s casual, it’s informal, and it’s free!

Our first Pop-Up concert‐on November 14th at 4pm‐will be hosted by St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church, 17 South Avenue in Beacon, and will feature the Heaton Sasaki Duo, two musicians recently transplanted to Beacon, Sara Heaton and Akiko Sasaki. They'll be taking us on a musical tour around the world, covering music from Germany, Japan, Brazil and the U.S.

Heaton and Sasaki have performed extensively both as soloists and as a duo at such venues as Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera. In addition to performing, they’re dedicated educators teaching privately in the Hudson Valley, based here in Beacon, and in New York City.
