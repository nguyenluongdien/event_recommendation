If you're in town for Christmas (as most industry folk are), Mint Nightlife is hosting the party of the year at Whisky Saigon. As thanks for you giving up your holidays and weekends all year long, we're doing an industry appreciation night (which is always fun)!

All restaurants/bars that sign up for a guestlist before Christmas Eve will receive FREE admission for anyone who checks in under your restaurant before midnight. 

Simply click "attend" and message me the restaurant name. 

Table minimums are only $300 and we'll be doing special giveaways and promotions throughout the night!

Please share this event and invite anyone you want, industry or not and let's truly make this a night to remember (or not). 

Theme: Little Red Dress
Date: 12/25/15
Time: 9:00 PM - 2:00 AM
Where:  Whisky Saigon
116 Boylston St, 
Boston, MA 02116

We are doing an optional little red dress theme for the ladies, but unfortunately, we do need to follow dress code for the club: no work boots, no shorts, and no gym sneakers. 

Please message me directly or text me at 617-816-3233 for all table requests. 

Hope to see you there!
