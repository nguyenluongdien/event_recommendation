Welcome, welcome Saigon people: Soul Burger invites you to an evening of comedy and music!

Come and enjoy some stand up from Saigon’s finest comedians, plus a couple of drunks we know who will play guitar. It’s going to be EPIC!

Soul Burger is usually closed on Mondays, but they will cook up some super-duper-delicious bar snacks --- the Chipotle Chicken Wings are off the chain! Plus Tiger Draft is only 40K all night!
 
Join us and make your Monday a little less painful x
