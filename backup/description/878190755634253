Put your best Santa Hat on and start your Christmas celebrations with some exercise. Join our annual Xmas JoyRide around your favourite district. Own the night by bringing a light, helmet and hi-vis gear on top of your best Santa outfit. Prizes for Best Dressed will apply! 
Afterwards we will gather for a Christmas drink at Container Pub on Street 15 in An Phu (just behind the Vista) - ALL welcome to this. For safety reasons children under 12 are not permitted on the ride.
