The story of England's hero king and of the greatest upset in European military history, Henry V is Shakespeare's conclusion to his great history plays.  More than that, this play - at once touching, heroic, savage, and comic - is Shakespeare's exploration of the nature of greatness and its connection to theatre.  This play, perhaps more than any other of Shakespeare's works, makes the audience part of the story.
