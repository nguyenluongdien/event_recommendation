The environmental changes - including the arrival of new generations (Y and Z), the disruptions due to the digital revolution, the growing competition and the development of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - are deeply impacting the way companies are managing their employees to increase organizational performance. HR management is becoming more strategic, more agile and more value-adding. More specifically, recruitment and talent retention practices are transformed by the new expectations of potential employees and the extensive use of digital tools such as the internal and external social networks.

This workshop will discuss about the new roles of HR managers in Vietnamese companies in order to respond to these environment changes, with the participation of Pr. Dr. Charles-Henri Besseyre des Horts - HRM professor at HEC Paris/CFVG.
