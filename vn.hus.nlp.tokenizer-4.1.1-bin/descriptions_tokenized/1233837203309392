Australia ’ s Trade and Investment_Minister , Andrew_Robb , recently released a strategic report titled , “ Why ASEAN and why now ? ” . The report highlights the importance of ASEAN as a key trading partner for Australia , accounting for 15 per cent of Australia ’ s total trade with a value of A$ 90 billion – this is larger market than any other single country , except China .
More than 600 million people live in ASEAN , half of whom are under the age of 35 . It has a booming middle class , rising per capita incomes , increased discretionary and discerning consumer behaviour , rapid urbanisation and heavy demand for infrastructure investment and value added services .
AusCham , together with Austrade , will host a business briefing that brings together government and private sector representatives with Australian interests to explore the impacts of imminent change in ASEAN on Vietnam and Australia .
Simon_Merrifield , Australia ’ s Ambassador to ASEAN based in Jakarta , will provide a key note address on the opportunities and challenges he sees for Australian businesses operating across ASEAN and other expert speakers from AusCham member businesses will share their practical observations and local experiences .
