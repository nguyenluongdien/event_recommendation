VN_HAT_XII
You kicked it at Turn_Up_Taiwan in September . You ’ ve dabbled in Manila_Spirits and tasted club glory at AOUC in Hong_Kong . But you still dream of chasing plastic one more time before 2015 blends into 2016 . Don ’ t worry . We ’ ve got you covered .
Saigon_Ultimate_Club ( SUC ) and RMIT Vietnam_Ultimate_Frisbee_Club ( RUC ) are proud to announce one of SE Asia ’ s gnarliest annual HAT tournaments ! The_Vietnam HAT returns for its 12th instalment , and this year , we ’ re bringing it back to where the heart of Vietnam beats loudest : the urban jungle of Saigon .
Vietnam HAT_XII will be held at RMIT University ’ s sports fields on December 19 and 20 . Come float a silky huck at one of SE Asia ’ s premiere natural grass fields . When you ’ re not playing , go cool down under the large covered grandstand overlooking the sports fields and watch other teams cannibalize each other .
Registration details / /
REGISTRATION_IS_CLOSED . BUT , if you are still interested in registering , please send us a message / email and we will review the available spaces .
The registration fee is set as the following :
Early bird fee is $ 70 USD .
Regular fee is $ 79 USD .
To qualify for early bird , you can do so in two ways :
[ 1 ] Purchase your flight BEFORE November 20th and forward us the confirmation email you receive from the airline to this email .
[ 2 ] PayPal or money transfer by the end of November . If you choose this option , shoot us an email and we ' ll forward you the details you need in order to accomplish that . Additional note , I realise that the bank and PayPal charges for electronic transfers might make this option unappealing . I would suggest you consider finding a friend or someone you know going to the tournament , pooling the registration costs into one transaction , and forwarding it to us that way .
If you choose to pay after December , at the registration party , or Saturday morning , you will have to pay the regular fee of $ 79 USD .
The individual registration fee will cover the following :
[ + ] a dope Vietnam HAT_XII disc
[ + ] a dope Vietnam HAT_XII jersey
