During the holiday season , we all enjoy the time with family and friends to relax and reminisce about the year past . Food and music are integral parts of our collective celebrations . So , in the spirit of the season , Saigon_Outcast will hold the wildly popular Farmers_Market on Saturday , December 13th .
The_Market is a family wide affair , including crafts for the young ones , live music for the old ones , and the same great beverages available for all you adults out there .
But , not to stop at the great entertainment available , Saigon_Outcast has organized some of the tastiest treats and freshest produce available in Vietnam .
50 stalls of fantastic local products , from the freshest veggies from Da_Lat courtesy of 4p ’ s Box delivery service , to Stone_Hill_Farms wide selection of Cocoa based beauty products , surely there will be something for every small elf to Santa_Claus look-a-like .
Be sure to get there early as the freshest of the fresh will be grabbed for gifts . But don ’ t worry as Saigon_Outcast has arranged for great live music to keep you satisfied right up to dinner . The well - heeled traditional band from Brittany , Gwennili will be playing from 4 to 6pm , with amazing covers of famous songs , while adding their own unique style to help you relax in the late day heat .
With the holidays upon us , and so many great gifts all in one place , for the low entry free of 20,000 , don ’ t miss this great sunday .
