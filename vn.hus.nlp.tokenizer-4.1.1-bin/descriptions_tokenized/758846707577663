▬ ▬ ▬ ▬ ▬ ▬ INTRO_MØ RBECK = Since his early youth Berlin born MØ RBECK was involved in the club scene of the German capital . Inspired by 90s Hip_Hop and Techno he set up his first studio in 2002 and began producing music of both genres . After working on several projects during the following years he eventually had his first releases on Berlin based label VAULT_SERIES in 2010 which gained widespread recognition . More releases ( and remixes ) followed on labels such as PERC_TRAX , SOMA , M-REC and FIFTH_WALL . And he played numerous clubs and festivals all across the globe . In 2013 he founded his own imprint CODE_IS_LAW , as a platform for his own music and for artists who shared his vision and passion for Techno . The love for the art and the striving for versatility can be observed not only in his work for the label but also in his DJ sets . The influences from his past are all coming together now shaping the typical sound : rough , groovy , melodic and constantly evolving Techno as you can hear on his most recent release – the highly acclaimed double EP T . R . I . P . S . ( S .

HOUSE & TECHNO_EXTRAVAGANZA
► B . A . X_LIVE : THE specialist to kick off hopefully another epic night marking the start of our 4th year . Now something different . BAX will play a LIVE_AMBIENT set , which is one of the sides of BAX we don ’ t often see but is in fact the world of BAX , as you can see here : Recording during Heart_Beat_June 8 , 2014 .
► MARCO_MEI avidly touring Asia but luckily at the right time at the right place or did he manipulate the situation to just be part of this circus of house & techno ? !
► OKO : will one more play back to back with Marco_Mei and his task to weave this story further into the night , embrace his tunes , grab those frequencies and stomp your feet .
► NIC_FORD with the most Heart_Beat nights under his belt takes the slot just after OKO . Nic played with Oliver_Ho , Andre_Kronert , Gregor_Welz , Marco_Effe and Chris_Wolter . As diverse as these all sound , as amazing Nic was able to connect either before or after them . You will see the master at work , or as we like to call him “ SIR_NIC . ”
► CHRIS_WOLTER currently in his melodic phase , but simultaneously producing the darker grooves . . what he will do with his slot after MØ RBECK is not a mystery for anyone that knows Chris . . expect to save some energy till the end .
► 1Dan . aka Dan_Rodgers was our guest in January this year and will take care of the breakfast shift for those last standers , that can ’ t stop dancing . He will make it extra difficult to leave the dance floor . Under the spell of 1Dan .
► VISUALS : EROL - Bringing his own projector this time , no light show will be needed , standing all night besides 7 DJ’ s this one man live show called Erol produces the visuals that will entangle with all the soundscapes , it is hard not to get hypnotised by his creations .

# B . A . X . Born in 1989 in Vietnam , Bách was taught to play the piano when he was 8 years old . At the age of 18 he discovered his passion for electronic music . In 2008 he started his own project B . A . X . B . A . X is known for two styles . One goes back longer and is the New_Age / Ambient music style , which makes listeners feel relaxed . The other style is House and Deep_House sets that B . A . X has been known to play with Heart_Beat since 2012 . His selection of tracks will make everyone crawl out of his / her shell , as the music becomes the cocoon . Bách started his new label called Feel of Life_Records on 01.08.2010 .
# ChrisWolter [ GER] hailing from Hanse city Rostock , with a very active scene , as we all have experienced these past 2 years . At least 5 guests from the Rostock area come over to Saigon .

Releasing his signature sound on Heart_Beat ’ s imprint with his latest techno bomb “ Scorpion ” following “ Bubi ” .

# NicFord - Avid record collector , music producer and sound designer , Nic_Ford has been playing eclectic dance music old and new at underground parties for the past 15 years . Collaborating with artists to create sound installations , laptop improvisations , studio releases on well respected record labels such as Third_Ear recordings , and currently as a solo artist for Deep_Booth records and part of Shift_Coordinate_Points . It is no easy task to blend the cerebral with the soulful – the two tend to stand at opposing corners in the deep house world and producers are often forced to choose one or the other – to mix both is a lofty aim .
