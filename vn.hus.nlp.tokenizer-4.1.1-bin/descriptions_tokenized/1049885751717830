We ' re a group of over 100 people from a variety of different countries that meet once a week to chat , practice speaking languages and make new friends .

We have little flag stickers from over 100 countries / regions . The first flag is your native language and goes at the top . The rest follow in order or ability . It ' s open to all nationalities and languages and you can talk about anything you like . You don ´ t have to be an advanced speaker , or even speak a second language - its for ALL levels !

Our events are free for participants , and always will be . When you arrive just ask at the bar or look for the table with the flags . If you ’ re shy , drop us a message and feel free to ask for any information .
