Over the past few months , the international stand - up comedy coming to Vietnam has been making all you good folks out there laugh your socks off . And being the kind souls that the organisers are , they are now flying in the father of stand - up in Southeast_Asia , Jonathan_Atherton . A veteran of the comedy scene and former presenter of Lonely_Planet , the Australian will be performing on Wednesday_Nov . 25 ( HCMC ) and Thursday_Nov . 26 ( Hanoi ) .
There have been other players promoting comedy in this region , but Jonathan_Atherton was responsible for establishing the genre in Singapore , Jakarta , Kuala_Lumpur , Bangkok and even Saigon . Man at the helm of Comedy_Club_Asia , and now with his own venue in Kuala_Lumpur , " The_Crackhouse " , Atherton first came to these fine climes in the 1990s . With 10 languages under his belt — he speaks them fluently , mind you — and boasting acting roles alongside none other than Robin_Williams , this versatile and dynamic comic is set to light up the stages of Vietnam . This guy is funny , so bring your catheters .
Of course , no show in this country is complete without the support , and coming all the way from the tropical paradise of Poland will be another man of firsts , Peter_Szumowski . A young , talented comedian , Peter ’ s five years on stage and national TV has seen him win a number of Polish awards ( untranslatable here ) . He is also responsible for putting on the first English-language comedy show in Poland . Presently on a life project titled , Comic_Around the World , Peter is travelling and performing in every place possible on this globe , from temples in Nepal to streets of New_Delhi , cock fighting arenas in Mexico and Aussie_Sports_Bars in , erm , Vietnam . Fortunately he ’ s performing his English set . So , nothing lost in translation on this one .
Also popping over for the Saigon show will be American , Phnom_Penh - based gagster , Sam_Thomas . Hailing from a place called Boston , Sam brough his flair for stand - up to Phnom_Penh three years ago . He has since become a fixture of the Southeast_Asian comedy open - mic scene , having performed in Phnom_Penh , Siem_Reap , Saigon , Kuala_Lumpur , Bangkok , Yangon and Singapore . He excels at telling jokes that won ’ t get him in trouble with his parents when they watch them on YouTube .
And of course , as ever in Hanoi there will be the story - telling jokesters and magicicans from Hanoi_Comedy_Collective . If you ’ ve seen them before , then take them in again . With so much comedy heading to the capital , and with you as the guinea pigs , they ’ re constantly writing new material .
