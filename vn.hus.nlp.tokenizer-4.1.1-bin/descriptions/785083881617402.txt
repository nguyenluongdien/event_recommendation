Jonathan Atherton, a veteran of the comedy scene and former presenter of Lonely Planet, will be headlining two stand-up comedy shows this coming week in both Saigon and Hanoi.

The Australian will start his tour of Vietnam on Wednesday Nov. 25 at Game On, 115 Ho Tung Mau, Q1, Ho Chi Minh City (Entrance: 200k, Doors: 8pm) before jetting it up to Hanoi to perform the following day at House of Son Tinh, 31 Xuan Dieu, Tay Ho, Hanoi (Entrance: 200k, Show: 8pm).

This guy's funny. Very funny. He is also responsible for helping create the stand-up comedy scene we now have in Singapore, KL, Bangkok, Phnom Penh and more recently, Ho Chi Minh City.

The ticket price includes a complimentary glass of Fullerâ€™s London Pride or Honey Dew Ale. For more information or to book tables, email nick@saigoninternationalcomedy.com or dan@highway4.com.
