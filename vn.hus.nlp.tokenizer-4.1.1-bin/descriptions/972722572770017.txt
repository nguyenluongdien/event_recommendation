The fist 2 SWP have been amazing. On Friday 6th November we throw the third instalment of Saigon Warehouse Project at Cargo Event Space. So lets go again and keep spreading the love to build up something special together in Saigon.

Movement began in Manchester UK, the birth place of Rave Culture and home to world famous clubs and parties such as Sankeys and Warehouse Project. We are here to share this culture in Saigon. 

House and Techno warehouse parties are much more than a night out, they are a musical experience and lifestyle. After years of experience throwing underground raves and parties underneath train tracks, abandoned factories and courtyards across Manchester, we are ready to take on Saigon.

Special GuestJoining Movement  TBA

Doors open at 10pm
Free entry before 11pm, 100k after.

**Please invite people to these events and we can grow together**
