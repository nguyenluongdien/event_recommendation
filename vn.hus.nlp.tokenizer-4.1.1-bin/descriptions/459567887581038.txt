Over an 8 week iOS course students learn a completely new language using the same curriculum used to teach engineers at Facebook, Dropbox, Box, Zynga, and many of the top startups in Silicon Valley. 

At this event they demonstrate their knowledge and skill by building a mini-startup.
 
From our iOS class 4 teams will be presenting to a selective list of judges from the Ho Chi Minh City technology community. The best team will be awarded a cash prize sponsored by Asia Innovations based on user experience design, value of solution, and technical difficulty.
