Thanh Nien U21 Int'l Football Championship to kick off in November

Reigning champion Hoang Anh Gia Lai Arsenal JMG may need its best players to defend its U21 International Football Championship title when the tournament kicks off in Ho Chi Minh City on November 20.

The 9th annual event, organized by Thanh Nien Newspaper, has attracted several strong teams, including those from Malaysia, Myanmar and South Korea. 

More teams from Australia and Thailand are considering joining, organizers said.

“Myanmar will send the team that has competed at the recent U20 World Cup in New Zealand, with seven new players who won the silver medal at last month’s 28th Southeast Asian Games in Singapore,” said Tran Quoc Tuan, deputy chairman of Vietnam Football Federation.

“Meanwhile, South Korea may send the team that defeated Vietnam 6-0 at the U20 World Cup qualifying round. It will be a tough competition with many strong players,” he said.

The championship will kick off at Ho Chi Minh City’s Thong Nhat Stadium, from November 20-30.

A domestic version of the tournament will be held at the same venue from October 20-30 to select two best local teams to play at the international event.

A total of 25 teams nationwide will be divided to four groups to select seven teams. Together with the host team of Ho Chi Minh City, these seven teams will then play in the final rounds.
