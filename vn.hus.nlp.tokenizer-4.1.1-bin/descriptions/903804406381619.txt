*****************

Hi everyone

We collected approx. 9,500,000vnd from November's SPAMCHAM. Thanks so much for all those who attended and contributed. A great result given the alarmingly low numbers in attendance.

This email serves as an early bird reminder to SAVE THE DATE for the earlier scheduled CHRISTMAS SPAMCHAM ON WEDNESDAY 16TH DECEMBER

There will be a small presentation before the raffle to show where your hard earned donations went to on the recent bike distribution day in An Giang Province. NOT TO BE MISSED……………REMEMBER – LORETO NEEDS YOU!

So ring your mates, work colleagues, family and ask them to come along for a fun-filled, great value night.

THE PERFECT CURTAIN RAISER TO THE FESTIVE SEASON!!!!

contact g.murphy@alfrescosgroup.com if you wish to donate a prize for the raffle

SEE YOU ALL THERE!!!!!!
