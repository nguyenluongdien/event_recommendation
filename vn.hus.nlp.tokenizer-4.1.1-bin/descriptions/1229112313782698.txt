The montly bass madness event is once again here.

BASS REPUBLIC, is Saigon's longest running bass and beats centric event and this week we are returning in full force in preparation for The Beats Saigon's 9th Anniversary on 12th December.

This month we have Hanoi's turntalist and funk specialist DUY TUAN as guest DJ, with his funky scratching flare. 

Along side DUY TUAN is resident JASE and JIN playing their deep and heavy beats.

BLESS THE BASS..

See you on the dancefloor
