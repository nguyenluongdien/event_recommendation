From Hennepin County Medial Center: I hope you will join us for an amazing afternoon on Thursday, Nov. 12, when we open a new helistop for helicopter ambulance service and break ground on the new clinic and surgery center.  The new helistop will make the regionâ€™s best trauma center even better by reducing transport time to HCMC for critically injured patients. The new clinic and surgery specialty center will make our primary and specialty care clinics and same day surgery center the most convenient and contemporary in the Twin Cities. 

This is a big day for HCMC, East Downtown, and our entire community and I hope you will join me on Thursday, November 12 in the big tent across the street from the 730 S. 8th Street entrance. Activities start with a program at 1 PM and continue with a reception and tours until 4 PM, so please mark your calendar to stop by and join in the fun!
