Ahoy! Our dear HCA-turned-PSC Kayla Flaten is having a Baby Boy! We're having a potluck dinner to celebrate. So throw down your anchor and join us to "whale"come Baby Oliver! 

The Baby Shower will be on Thursday, November 19th from 6pm - 8pm in the HCMC ED Breakroom. There will be a potluck  meal with appetizers, soups, sandwiches, and desserts, so please bring a dish to share. If you're working that day, please come a little early or stay a little late to celebrate! 

Kayla is registered at Target, but she is welcoming any items that new parents found especially helpful or wished they had known about for their babies. 

If you have any questions, or want to get signed up to bring a dish for the potluck, please contact Britta or Jessica, or comment with what you'll bring! Thank you!
