Hey All!

So I desperately want to see Miss Saigon again before it closes in February. Maybe even twice, as it is my birthday February 22nd. 

There are still loads of cheap tickets out there, cheapest ive found so far is around Â£27.50, but will keep searching. 

It might be a little soon, but I wonder if everyone is free around the 18th or 19th December? If not post below your availability. If i've missed people off the list, just add them :)

Thanks hope to see you there!
