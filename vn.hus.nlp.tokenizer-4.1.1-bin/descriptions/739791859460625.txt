It’s Pygmalion in Footscray. David is about to
retire as a high school English Literature teacher,
but faces major problems. His retirement plans
are ruined when his family and fortunes head
south. He moves to a new world in Footscray.
Thanh is a young Vietnamese woman recently
arrived in Footscray. Her life to date has been
amazing – she speaks no English, makes clothes
for a pittance, and lives with her grandparents
who speak only Vietnamese.
Julia is David’s elderly widowed mother, in poor
health, wealthy and selfish. These three
characters star in a love story with a difference.
