The first Saigon Street Food/Craft Beer Pairing event we had was inspired by my sister's visit to Vietnam . . . it was the best event!  Everyone loved the food and the beer pairings were right on!  Inspired by the flavors, conversation went on for hours!

Josh and I wanted to present this event again.  You seriously don't want to miss this!  

Each course will be paired perfectly with a local craft beer.  Engage in conversation about nose, hops and bitters and enjoy a taste of Saigon street foods!

*I will be updating the menu with craft beer selections as they become available to me (my obscure beer expert is selecting the perfect sidekick for each course!)
