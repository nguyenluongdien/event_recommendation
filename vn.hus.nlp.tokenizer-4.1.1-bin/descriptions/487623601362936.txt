Friday FiX returns to CUBE with something a little different for the Saigon raving massive!

We're still committed to bringing that London rave vibe to town and this time our DJs are gonna take their selections deeper, getting more introspective with abstract beats and styles of Drum&Bass, Jungle, Acid House, Breaks, UKBass and more. 

We've put together a sick line up of local talent and will be decking out Cube Bar with extra smoke, lighting and visuals. 

It's free entry & tequila shots are only 50K all night:
Buckle up your blue suede shoes and get ready to skank!
