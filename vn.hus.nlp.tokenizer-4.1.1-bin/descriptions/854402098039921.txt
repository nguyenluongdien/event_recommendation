We learn many things about how to use diffrent kind of machines but we do not know almost anything about the most complicat sistem , ourself, our Human machine.
It is evident that people react mechanically when faced with the diverse circumstances of life…
Poor people! They always tend to convert themselves into victims.
When someone flatters them they smile, when someone humiliates them they suffer. If they are insulted they insult, if they are hurt they hurt; they are never free, their fellow men have the power to drive them from joy to sadness, from hope to despair.
Each of these persons that go along the “horizontal path” looks like a musical instrument where each one of their fellow men plays what he pleases…
Whoever learns to transform the mechanical relations is, in fact, entering the “vertical path.”
